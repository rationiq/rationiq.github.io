AUDIT YOUR FUEL — THROUGH OPTICAL INTELLIGENCE

Meet RATION-IQ
An advanced Generative AI system for automated nutritional intelligence and readiness tracking.

RATION-IQ analyzes a single photo of your DFAC tray or meal to deliver instant caloric, macro, and nutrient intelligence — no manual logging, no estimates.

BUILT FOR MISSION READINESS

RATION-IQ is engineered for modern military personnel who require fuel discipline, data accuracy, and operational readiness.

Most military fitness apps are static calculators.
They tell you your score after the test is over.

RATION-IQ is predictive.

An NCO uses static apps to log results.
An NCO uses RATION-IQ to ensure their squad passes before test day - by optimizing DFAC tray choices days in advance.

AFT-READY BY DESIGN

With the 2026 Army Fitness Test (AFT) Combat Standards effective January 1, 2026, RATION-IQ introduces Performance Path logic.

RATION-IQ does not guess.
It shows the exact nutritional path required to meet performance thresholds.

STRATEGIC BRIEFING: THE INTEL GAP
